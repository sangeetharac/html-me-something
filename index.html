                    <h2 class="h2-class">THE JACKAL AND THE DRUM</h2> 
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Once upon a time, in a jungle there lived a jackal by the name of Gomaya. 
                        One day, he was very hungry and was wandering in search of food. While wandering, he came across a 
                        battle field. There he saw a big drum lying under a tree. When the wind blew, a tender branch grown 
                        at the root of the tree struck the drum producing sound of a drum beat. The jackal examined the drum 
                        from all sides and then beat the drum with his front paws. The drum made a sound. Now the jackal 
                        thought that there might be some other small animal inside the drum and that would make a very 
                        tasty meal for him. But he found the top of the drum too tough to tear off. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The jackal thought of a plan and began to beat the drum with both his front paws.
                        The sound of drumbeat filled the whole jungle. A leopard who was attracted towards 
                        the sound of the drum, came near it. The jackal said to the leopard, &quot;Your Majesty, 
                        there is some animal hiding inside the drum. Since you have sharp claws and strong teeth, 
                        you can tear off the top of the drum and catch your prey inside the drum. 
                        The leopard was himself hungry So he hit the top of the drum with his heavy paws. 
                        The drum burst with a sound, but there was no animal inside. The drum was empty. 
                        Seeing the empty drum, the leopard became very angry and said to the jackal, &quot;You 
                        have wasted my time. There is no food inside the drum. So I will kill and eat you.&quot; 
                        The leopard pounced upon the jackal and killed and ate him.

                <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. 
                        It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. 
                        Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a 
                        small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse 
                        requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away. On another day, 
                        the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it escaped. 
                        There after, the mouse and the lion became friends. They lived happily in the forest afterwards.

                <h2 class="h2-class">  THE FOX AND THE GRAPES </h2>
                <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One afternoon a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes
                        hanging from over a lofty branch. &quot;Just the thing to quench my thirst,&quot; he thought.Taking a few 
                        steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again the fox took a few paces back and tried 
                        to reach them but still failed.Finally, giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, &quot;They&#39;re 
                        probably sour anyway,&quot; and proceeded to walk away.

                <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slave, ill-treated by his master, runs away to the forest. There he comes across 
                        a lion in pain because of a thorn in his paw. The slave bravely goes forward and removes the thorn gently.
                        The lion without hurting him goes away.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days later, the slave&#39;s master comes hunting to the forest and catches many
                        animals and cages them. The slave is spotted by the masters&#39; men who catch him and bring him to the 
                        cruel master. The master asks for the slave to be thrown into the lion&#39;s cage.The slave is awaiting 
                        his death in the cage when he realizes that it is the same lion that he had helped. The slave rescued the
                        lion and all other caged animals.

                <h2 class="h2-class">THE FOOLISH DONKEY </h2>
                <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A salt seller used to carry the salt bag on his donkey to the market every day.
                        On the way they had to cross a stream. One day the donkey suddenly tumbled down the stream and the salt 
                        bag also fell into the water. The salt dissolved in the water and hence the bag became very light to carry. 
                        The donkey was happy.Then the donkey started to play the same trick every day.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The salt seller came to understand the trick and decided to teach a lesson to it. The next day he loaded 
                        a cotton bag on the donkey.Again it played the same trick hoping that the cotton bag would be still become
                         lighter.But the dampened cotton became very heavy to carry and the donkey suffered. It learnt a lesson. 
                         It didn&#39;t play the trick anymore after that day, and the seller was happy.
